# Scripts

All scripts on the `old` folder are working but they are not refactored.

All scripts on the `to_refactor-fix` folder don't work and need some refactoring and fixes.

All scripts on the `to_test` folder need to be tested in order to know if they are working properly, or they need some refactoring and fix.

All scripts outside these folders are tested, refactored and working.
