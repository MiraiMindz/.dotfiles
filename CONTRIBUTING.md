## Branching Strategy

We follow a branching strategy to manage the different machines and rices that this repo has, the `<main>` branch is the updated and currently rice in use by me, the other branches are older versions or other machines and rices.

The archived rices will be on the `<archived>` branch, within folders containing it's used machine name and hostname and also the date of archiving, example: `LGS430_miraimachine_09-05-2023`

The other branches will follow the naming convention of `<machine-name_host-name_theme>`, example: `USB-Stick_miraiusb_catppuccin`

## Code Review Process

All contributions undergo a code review process to ensure quality and maintainability. During this process, reviewers will provide feedback, suggestions, and request changes as necessary. To facilitate the code review process:

- Be open to feedback and willing to make changes based on the reviewer's suggestions.
- Respond promptly to any code review comments or requests for changes.
