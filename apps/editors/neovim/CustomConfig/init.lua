    So first of all, I'll document/explain  my docs because  some of my friends
    are using  them to base  their configs,  thus, I thought that would be cool
    if I added  some explanation  of that they  do,  and I hope you enjoy them.
    I recommend for everyone to read: https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html
                                                                        - Mirai

-- This line will load my configs, I opted for a separated module, so I could
-- have multiple configs, and load them as I pleased.

print("LOADED MAIN init.lua")
require("mirai")
