# .dotfiles

These are my .dotfiles :]

If you don't know, .dotfiles are basically configurations files in unix-like systems

after setting up the base of an Arch Install (Partitions and Network Connection) you can clone my ArchInstallBase script and run it with the following command:

`curl -fLo archInstallBase.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiraiMindz/.dotfiles/main/archInstallBase.sh && sh archInstallBase.sh`
