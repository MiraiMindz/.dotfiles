# .dotfiles

These are my .dotfiles :]

If you don't know, .dotfiles are basically configurations files in unix-like systems

after setting up the bare-base of an Arch Install (Partitions and Network Connection) you can clone my ArchInstallBase script and run it with the following command:

`curl -fLo archInstallBase.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiraiMindz/.dotfiles/main/archInstallBase.sh" && sh archInstallBase.sh`

during the install you will need to clone the other 2 scripts, here are the lines:

`curl -fLo archInstallAfter.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiraiMindz/.dotfiles/main/archInstallAfter.sh" && archInstallAfter.sh`

`curl -fLo installConfigs.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiraiMindz/.dotfiles/main/installConfigs.sh" && installConfigs.sh`
