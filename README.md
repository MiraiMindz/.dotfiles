# Dotfiles

![DotfilesLogo](./assets/meta/images/Headers/DotFiles.svg)

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This collection of dotfiles contains the configuration files for various tools and applications I use on a daily basis. By version controlling these files with Git, I can easily synchronize my configurations across multiple machines and quickly set up new environments.

## Introduction

Dotfiles are hidden configuration files that are typically stored in the user's home directory (`~`, `$HOME`, `/home/<username>`). They control the behavior and appearance of software applications, shells, and other tools. This repository provides a central location to store and manage these dotfiles, making it easy to maintain a consistent setup across different machines.

## Installation

I'm currently working on it.

## Usage

Once the dotfiles are installed, you can easily update your configurations or add new ones by modifying the respective files in the `~/.dotfiles` directory. The changes will be automatically reflected in your system.

It's worth mentioning that some dotfiles might require you to restart the corresponding application or shell for the changes to take effect.

You can also add additional scripts or installers in the `~/.dotfiles` directory to automate the setup of other tools or applications. Feel free to explore the existing files and directories to get a better understanding of the available configurations.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `apps/`: This folder contains all of the user-scoped tools.
- `system/`: This folder contains all of the system-wide tools.
- `assets/`: This folder contains all assets or non-essential files.
- `LICENSE`: The MIT license file.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: The Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct file.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: The file that tells how to contribute.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading.
- `README_BR.md`: The portuguese-brazillian version of this file.

Feel free to modify the structure according to your preferences or specific needs. You can add or remove directories and files as necessary.

## Customization

These dotfiles serve as a starting point, but you can customize them to match your own preferences and workflow. Here are a few ways to do that:

- Modify the existing dotfiles: Open the respective files in the `~/.dotfiles` directory and make the necessary changes. Each file usually contains comments explaining the purpose of the configuration options.
- Add new dotfiles: Create a new file in the appropriate directory or create a new directory altogether. Make sure to update the installation script to symlink the new dotfiles to the appropriate locations.

Remember to keep your changes within the `~/.dotfiles` directory to maintain portability and ease of synchronization across different machines.
